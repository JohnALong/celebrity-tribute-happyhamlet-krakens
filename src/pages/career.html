                <p>
                    Zach Galifianakis was born in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, to Mary
                    Frances (Cashion), who owned a community arts center, and Harry Galifianakis, a heating oil vendor.
                    His
                    father is of Greek descent and his mother is of mostly English and Scottish ancestry. Zach moved to
                    New
                    York
                    City after failing his last college class by one point. Zach got his start performing his brand of
                    humor
                    in
                    the back of a hamburger joint in Times Square. He toured the country, performing in coffee shops and
                    universities.

                    After more than a decade performing stand-up and making both television and film appearances, Zach
                    broke
                    through to wider recognition with his co-starring role as "Alan Garner", in the comedy mega-hit, The
                    Hangover (2009). Later that year, he played a large role in the CGI-heavy kids movie, G-Force
                    (2009),
                    and
                    then appeared in memorable supporting parts in the films, Up in the Air (2009) (as a laid-off
                    employee),
                    Youth in Revolt (2009) (as a loutish stepfather), and Dinner for Schmucks (2010), as one of the
                    title
                    characters. More recently, he co-starred with Keir Gilchrist in the teen dramedy, It's Kind of a
                    Funny
                    Story
                    (2010), with Robert Downey Jr. in the road trip comedy, Due Date (2010), and alongside Will Ferrell
                    in
                    the
                    political spoof, The Campaign (2012). He also voiced "Humpty Dumpty" in the animated film, Puss in
                    Boots
                    (2011), and reprised his character in both The Hangover Part II (2011) and The Hangover Part III
                    (2013).
                    In
                    2014, he appeared in the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, Birdman or (The Unexpected
                    Virtue
                    of
                    Ignorance) (2014), and in 2016, he starred in the comedies Masterminds (2016) and Keeping Up with
                    the
                    Joneses (2016), released three weeks apart.

                    When not performing and acting, Zach spends time at his home in the mountains of his native North
                    Carolina,
                    where he hopes to open a writer's retreat on a completely self-sustained farm.
